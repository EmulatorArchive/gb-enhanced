//100-199 = Joystick buttons 0 through 99 (button number layout varies from controller to controller)
//
//200-299 = Joystick axes 0 - 24. Numbering goes left, right, up, down
//For example, 200 is left for the first axis, 201 is right for first axis, 202 is up, 203 is down
//The next axis would have 204 for left, 205 for right, 206 for up, 207 for down
//
//300-399 = Joystick hats (aka DPads). Numbering goes left, right, up, down
//Follows the same pattern as axes (see above)
//First hat's left is 300, right is 301, up is 302, down is 303
//
//For simplicity's sake, this default works for the XBOX 360 controller
