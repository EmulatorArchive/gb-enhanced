# Project Status #
The current GB Enhanced project is no longer active. The project's successor, GB Enhanced+ (simply called gbe-plus or GBE+) aims to be a better emulator, providing support for the GB, GBC, and the GBA. It will also offer support for Custom Graphics for **all** three systems and feature a much-needed GUI. All work is being diverted to the new project which can be found here:

# Overview #

GB Enhanced (GBE for short) aims to be a fully functional Game Boy emulator. The goal is to create a highly portable emulator using C++ and SDL, document the Game Boy's functions through clear code, and add as many enhancements (scaling filters, cheats, custom sprites) as reasonably possible.
